==Overall goal==
* capture all events that are bounded, delegated and lived
* store this info in some table, 
* ui to query info and view stuff

==What we should record==
#Modify jquery's bind/once to record:
#* selector
#* element
#* function (name, file would be nice)
#* how it was bound (live, delegate, once, bind)
#* trace - (where in the code it was triggered)
#Modify trigger to record:
#* # times of fired
#* trigger time
#* event 
#* trace - (where in the code it was triggered)

==Questions we want answered:==
#What and how are events being bound to this element
#How many events are we binding to and how many events are never fired

==Technical issues==
*How to test
==Reach for==
* Bookmarklet - maybe?
* non-jquery event reporting
* nice html interface for viewing read out
* useful console/query tool
* ie
